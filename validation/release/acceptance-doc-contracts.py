"""Fail closed when prose restates an acceptance count the contract no longer derives.

`flasher_acceptance_contract.py` owns the qualification matrix. Several release documents restate
its sizes in prose so a reader knows what they owe without reading Python. Those restatements do
not update themselves: the acceptance README carried the four-board era's "eight rows" long after
the shipping set grew to five boards, and `release/flash/README.md` carried the same stale number
in a second place while contradicting itself two paragraphs earlier.

This check never stores a count. It derives every number from the contract, then requires each
governed document to state exactly that number. Growing `SHIPPING_BOARDS` turns every affected
sentence red at once, with the file and line to fix.

The sweep below then rejects any *unregistered* count in the same documents, so a new restatement
cannot be added without being bound here too. It recognizes the subjects these documents actually
use; wholly new phrasing for a new quantity still needs a new entry.
